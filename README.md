# Password Checker

## Description
This C++ program is a simple password checker that verifies if a given password meets certain criteria. It's a great project for beginners learning about C++ strings, character manipulation, and basic control structures.

## Features
- Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long
- Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter
- Ensures the password contains at least one digit

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. When prompted, enter a password.
4. The program will inform you whether the password is valid or invalid based on the criteria.

## Code Structure
- The program uses C-strings to store the password.
- It utilizes functions from `<cstring>` and `<cctype>` for string manipulation and character checking.
- A loop is used to iterate through the password characters and check for uppercase letters and digits.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ libraries

## Future Improvements
- Add more password criteria (e.g., special characters, lowercase letters)
- Implement strength rating for passwords
- Allow users to set their own criteria
